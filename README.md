# scribus_manual
A test repository to migrate the scribus wiki documentation to reStucturedText.

The tools are originally from ideasman42 repository: https://github.com/ideasman42/blender_manual

I have madified them to be able to migrate the scribus wiki. Also some improvements have been added in the mean time. All credits though should go to the original developers.
